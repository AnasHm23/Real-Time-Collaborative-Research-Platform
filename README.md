# Real-Time Collaborative Research Platform

## Overview
The **Real-Time Collaborative Research Platform** is a web application designed to facilitate research collaboration, data sharing, and experimentation in real-time. It provides researchers, data scientists, and scholars with a space to work together on experiments, analyze datasets, and communicate efficiently. The platform supports experiment creation, real-time updates, asynchronous task management, and a notification system to keep users informed about important changes.

This platform integrates core features such as real-time collaboration with WebSockets, background task processing with Celery, and secure authentication with JWT. It is an excellent tool for researchers looking to manage experiments and datasets collaboratively.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with customizable user roles (Admin, Researcher, Guest).
- **Experiment Management**: Create, update, and delete experiments; link datasets to experiments.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebSocket-powered real-time updates for experiments and dataset changes.
- **Asynchronous Task Management**: Celery for processing long-running tasks like data simulations or experiment analysis.
- **Commenting System**: Users can comment on experiments, datasets, and results.
- **Notifications**: Real-time and email notifications for important updates, such as new comments or experiment progress.
- **Data Filtering & Pagination**: Filter experiments and datasets, and paginate through large lists.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle API requests to prevent abuse and optimize resource usage.
- **Caching**: Use Redis caching to speed up frequently accessed data.
- **Testing & CI/CD**: Unit tests, automated deployment, and integration with CI/CD tools.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), Django Channels, Celery
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Task Management**: Celery, Redis as a message broker
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets via Django Channels
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Testing**: Pytest, Django’s testing framework
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional), Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS for hosting

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL (for production)
- Redis (for task queuing and caching)

### Clone the repository

**bash**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Time-Collaborative-Research-Platform.git
cd Real-Time-Collaborative-Research-Platform

### Create a virtual environment and activate it
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
